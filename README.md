The frame of Spacecraft class is to build a spacecraft with engine, weapons and shield.
The Engine take fuel type, max speed, gear box and other as attributes
The Energy is the fuel using by the engine
The Weapon and Shield shield have not been completed yet

The Space class is to handle the ship and all enemies, bullets, as well as the background theme while flying.
The Planet class is to handle the character when landing,including upgrade, repair,etc. And generate next mission.

The chapter contains the information of current mission, the distance to next planet, and enemy pattern, difficulty.
My plan is to classify the planet by its scale(level), thus the chapter of one flight between two planets is generate randomly by this.
